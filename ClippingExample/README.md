ClippingExample - Solution code
===============================

This app demonstrates how to use and combine clipping regions,
and how to draw and transform text on a canvas. 

Introduction
------------

Demonstrates how setting different clipping paths affects the 
drawing of rectangles, lines, text, and circles.

This app draws seven squares that each demonstrates a clipping
region, or combination of several clipping regions, including
a picture frame, circular clipping, and using a DIFFERENCE and
INTERSECT operator when combining clipping regions. 

The app also demonstrates how to draw transformed text on a 
canvas, using translation and skewing.
