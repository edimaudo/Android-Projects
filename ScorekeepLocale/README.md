ScorekeepLocale - Solution Code
===============================

The Scorekeeper app that keeps score with plus and minus buttons,
localized for Hebrew and Afrikaan.

Introduction
------------

This app consists of two sets of buttons and two text views used to
keep track of the score for any point-based game with two players.
The localization challenge is to:

- Change the red color for the minus buttons to a different color
for the Afrikaan (South Africa) language (locale) choice due to
cultural differences in the use of the color red.

- Change the text size for the team names to 40sp in Hebrew only,
because the Hebrew text is too small to read.

- How to open, build, and run apps with Android Studio.
