Welcome to Project: Dogglers app!

At Google, we affectionately call our coworkers Googlers. With many Googlers owning dogs as pets, we thought it would be fun to create an app for our canine friends, called Dogglers. Your task is to implement Dogglers, which shows scrolling lists of Googlers' pet dogs along with a bit of information about each one, such as their name, age, hobbies, and a photo. In this project, you'll build layouts for the RecyclerView items in the Dogglers app, and implement an adapter so that the list of dogs can be presented three ways: by horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling, and vertically scrolling grid layout.

When you launch the app, you're provided with options for horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts.

The first option is a vertical scrolling recycler view with items that take up the full width of the screen.

The second option shows the list of dogs in a horizontally scrolling recycler view.

The third option shows the dogs in a vertically scrolling grid-style layout where two dogs are shown on each row.

All of these layouts are powered by the same adapter class. Your task will be to build the layouts for the recycler view cards, and then implement the adapter so that each item is populated with the information about each dog.
