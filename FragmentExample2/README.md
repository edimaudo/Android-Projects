FragmentExample2 - Solution Code
================================

This app shows how to add a dynamic fragment to FragmentExample1
that enables users to add or remove the fragment from the
activity's UI as needed.

Introduction
------------

The app improves FragmentExample1 by changing a static fragment
to a dynamic fragment, which can be added, replaced, or removed
during the lifetime of its parent activity.

Users can open or close the fragment by clicking a button in the
main activity. The fragment provides radio buttons for the user
to choose "yes" or "no".

- Open, build, and run apps with Android Studio.
