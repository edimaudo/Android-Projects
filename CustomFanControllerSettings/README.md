CustomFanControllerSettings - Solution Code
===========================================

Defines custom attributes for the number of selections
and the "on" and "off" colors for the dial
created in CustomFanController.

Introduction
------------

The app creates a circular UI element that resembles a physical fan control.
It uses a custom view that extends View to draw a circular dial with
selections ranging from 0-2 to 0-9 based on the user's
choice in the options menu.

When the user clicks the dial, it moves the dial indicator to the next selection
and changes the dial's color from the "off" color for selection 0 to the "on"
color for all other selections.

The user can choose the number of selections around the dial
by using the options menu in the app bar.
