FragmentCommunicate - Solution Code
===================================

This app shows how to save a choice the user makes in a fragment,
so that the choice is already selected when the fragment is reopened.

Introduction
------------

The app improves FragmentExample2 to communicate between the fragment
and the host activity. The activity retrieves the user's choice for
the "yes" or "no" question from the fragment. If the user reopens
the fragment after making a choice, the activity sends the
choice to the fragment so that the choice is already selected.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know how to:
- Open, build, and run apps with Android Studio.
- Create a fragment with an interactive UI.
- Add a static fragment to the UI layout of an activity.
- Add, replace, and remove a dynamic fragment while an activity is running.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the code.
2. Open the code in Android Studio.
3. Run the app.
