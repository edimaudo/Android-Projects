SurfaceViewExample - Solution code
===========================================

The user is presented with a dark surface with a white circle.
This represents a wall shone at with a flashlight cone. Touching the
surface hides an android image. The light cone then follows continuous
motion. If the image of an android is discovered, the screen lights up and
the word "WIN!" appears. To restart lift finger and touch screen again.

Introduction
------------

This app demonstrates how to use a SurfaceView to render an image from a
separate thread.
In addition, it shows how you can use clipping for animation,
and implements a basic game loop. This is not intended as a production
quality app. Rather, it demonstrates the basics
of these techniques, so you can dive deeper on your own.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know:
- Create apps with Android Studio and run them on a mobile device.
- Create a custom view.
- Draw on and clip a Canvas.
- Add event handlers to views.
- Understand basic threading.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
